# Star Wars Character Finder - JavaFX Application

## Overview

This is a JavaFX application built using Maven that allows users to search for Star Wars characters by name. The application interacts with the SWAPI (Star Wars API) to retrieve character data. The project showcases the integration of JavaFX with a RESTful API, demonstrating the use of modern Java development practices.

### Features

	•	Search Functionality: Users can search for Star Wars characters by entering a name or part of a name in a text field. The application then queries the SWAPI to fetch matching characters.
	•	Data Display: Results are displayed in a table with the character names. If no characters are found, the user is informed accordingly.
	•	Detailed View: Users can click on a character in the table to view detailed information about the selected character on a new screen.
	•	Navigation: The detailed view includes a “Back” button, allowing users to return to the search screen.

### Technologies Used

	•	Java 11+: The application is compatible with Java 11 and above.
	•	JavaFX: Used for building the user interface.
	•	Maven: For project management and dependency management.
	•	Gson: For handling JSON data retrieved from the SWAPI.
